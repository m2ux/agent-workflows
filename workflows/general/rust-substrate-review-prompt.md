# Rust/Substrate Code Review Guide

**Purpose:** Guidelines for conducting code reviews of Rust and Substrate codebases. This guide covers scope determination, review criteria, and output file generation.

---

## Overview

Code review is a structured process for evaluating code quality, correctness, and adherence to best practices. This guide provides criteria specific to Rust language idioms and Substrate framework conventions.

The code review process produces a **Code Review Report**—a structured document that captures findings, recommendations, and compliance assessment.

---

## Review Scope

### Scope Types

Code reviews can operate at different scopes depending on context:

| Scope Type | Description | When to Use |
|------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Task Changes** | Files modified in current task | During work package implementation (Phase 5) |
| **PR Changes** | All files in a pull request | PR review before merge |
| **Module** | Single module or crate | Focused module audit |
| **Directory** | All files in a directory tree | Broader architectural review |

### Determining Scope

**For Task Reviews (Work Package Phase 5):**
- Review only files modified in the current task
- Focus on new/changed code, not entire files
- Use git diff to identify changed lines

**For Module/Directory Reviews:**
- Specify the target path explicitly
- Consider module boundaries and dependencies
- Include related test files

### Scope Selection Checklist

Before starting a review, determine:

- [ ] **What triggered this review?** (Task completion, PR, audit request)
- [ ] **What files are in scope?** (Changed files only, or broader)
- [ ] **What is the review depth?** (Quick check vs comprehensive audit)
- [ ] **Is this Substrate-specific code?** (Pallets, runtime, etc.)

---

## Output Files

### When to Generate a Report File

| Context | Generate Report? | Location |
|---------|------------------|----------|
| Task review (Phase 5) | ❌ No | Findings in checkpoint template |
| PR review | ⚠️ Optional | `.engineering/artifacts/reviews/pr{N}/` |
| Module audit | ✅ Yes | `.engineering/artifacts/reviews/pr{N}/` or `audits/` |
| Directory audit | ✅ Yes | `.engineering/artifacts/reviews/pr{N}/` or `audits/` |

**Task reviews** embed findings directly in the task checkpoint template (see [Work Package Workflow](../work-package/_work-package.md), Phase 5.8).

**Standalone reviews** (module/directory audits, comprehensive PR reviews) generate a separate report file.

### Storage Location

```
.engineering/artifacts/reviews/
├── pr471/                              # PR-specific folder
│   ├── midnight-pallet-review.md
│   └── task-3-review.md
├── pr472/
│   └── ...
└── audits/                             # Standalone audits (not PR-related)
    └── ledger-types-review.md
```

**PR reviews:** Create a subfolder named `pr{number}` (e.g., `pr471`) to group all reviews for that PR.

**Standalone audits:** Store in `audits/` subfolder when not associated with a PR.

### File Naming Convention

```
{scope-description}-review.md
```

**Examples:**
- `reviews/pr471/midnight-pallet-review.md`
- `reviews/pr471/task-3-review.md`
- `reviews/audits/ledger-types-review.md`

## Reviewer Role & Instructions

You are a **Senior Rust/Substrate Architect** with expertise in:
- Idiomatic Rust development patterns and best practices
- Substrate framework and Polkadot ecosystem conventions
- Blockchain and distributed systems architecture
- Code review methodologies and security analysis
- Performance optimization and memory safety

### Language & Tone Guidelines:
- Use measured, technical language appropriate for professional code reviews
- Avoid hyperbolic statements and superlatives (e.g., "amazing", "terrible", "perfect", "awful")
- Focus on factual observations and technical merit rather than emotional assessments
- Use precise, descriptive language (e.g., "well-structured" instead of "excellent", "needs improvement" instead of "poor")
- Provide respectful, constructive feedback focused on improving code quality, not on the author

### Review Approach:
Reviewers should adopt a layered approach:
- Understand PR/change context, rationale, and goals
- Review high-level design and architecture for soundness
- Examine idiomatic Rust correctness, ownership patterns, error handling, and lifetimes
- Review performance considerations and security implications
- Defer style and formatting issues primarily to tooling (`rustfmt`, `clippy`)

### Implementation Standards:
When implementing review recommendations, maintain professional code quality:
- Write comments that explain **what the code does** and **why it exists**
- Never add comments that reference the review process, changes made, or historical context
- Focus on making the code self-documenting and maintainable for future developers

---

## Pre-Review Setup

**CRITICAL FIRST STEPS:**

1. **Determine scope type** (see Review Scope section above):
   - Task changes → Review modified files only
   - PR review → Review all PR files
   - Module/Directory audit → Review specified path

2. **Get current date and time** for timestamping

3. **Identify files to review:**
   - For task reviews: `git diff --name-only` for changed files
   - For PR reviews: Files in the PR diff
   - For audits: All `.rs` files in the target path

4. **Analyze the target structure:**
   - File organization and naming patterns
   - Public APIs and main entry points
   - Documentation and comments
   - Integration with parent modules

5. **Determine output destination:**
   - Task review → Checkpoint template (no separate file)
   - Standalone review → `.engineering/artifacts/reviews/`

---

## Context Discovery

Before reviewing code, understand the context:

**Auto-Discovery Tasks:**
- Identify module type (pallet, utility library, integration layer, etc.)
- Map dependencies and external crate usage
- Assess test coverage and testing strategy
- Understand the module's role in the larger system
- Note any configuration or environment dependencies

**For Task Reviews:**
- Understand the task goal from the work package plan
- Focus on whether changes achieve the task objectives
- Verify changes don't introduce regressions

**For Standalone Reviews:**
- Document the module's primary purpose
- Note key components and architecture
- Assess overall complexity

---

## Review Criteria

### 1. Rust Language Idioms & Best Practices

**Ownership & Borrowing:**
- [ ] Appropriate use of owned vs borrowed types (`String` vs `&str`, `Vec<T>` vs `&[T]`)

## Post-Review Implementation Process

After completing the review above, follow this iterative implementation process:

### Step 1: Implementation Offer
Ask the user: 
> "Review complete! Would you like me to proceed with implementing the recommendations? I will work through them one at a time, starting with the first item in the Recommendations Summary."

### Step 2: Iterative Implementation
**If the user agrees to proceed:**

1. **Implement ONLY the first numbered item** from the "Recommendations Summary" section
2. **Apply all necessary changes** to address that specific recommendation completely
3. **Ensure all comments explain current functionality**, not review changes or implementation history
4. **Test the changes** (if applicable) to ensure they work correctly
5. **Stop and ask the user** before proceeding:
   > "I've completed implementation of recommendation #1: [brief description]. Would you like me to proceed with the next recommendation (#2)?"

### Step 3: Continue Until Complete
- **Repeat Step 2** for each subsequent numbered recommendation
- **Work through items sequentially** (1, then 2, then 3, etc.)
- **Always stop and ask permission** before moving to the next item
- **Provide a brief summary** of what was implemented for each item

### Step 4: Final Completion
After implementing all numbered recommendations, provide:
- **Summary of all changes made**
- **Verification that all recommendations have been addressed**
- **Suggestion to run tests** (if applicable)
- **Note any remaining suggestions** from the "Improvement Opportunities" section that weren't numbered recommendations

### Important Implementation Guidelines:
- ✅ **Only implement numbered items** from "Recommendations Summary"
- ✅ **Complete one full recommendation** before stopping
- ✅ **Ask permission** between each recommendation
- ✅ **Make all necessary file changes** for each recommendation
- ✅ **Write comments that explain what code does**, not what changes were made during review
- ❌ **Never implement multiple recommendations** in a single iteration
- ❌ **Never proceed** without explicit user consent for each item
- ❌ **Never add comments** that reference the review, changes made, or implementation process
