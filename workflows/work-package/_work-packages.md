# Work Packages Workflow

**Version:** 1.2  
**Last Updated:** January 2026  
**Purpose:** Organize multiple related work packages into an actionable roadmap

---

## Overview

This workflow defines how to plan and coordinate **multiple work packages** that share context, dependencies, or a common initiative. It produces a structured planning folder with analysis, prioritization, and links to individual work package plans.

**Use this workflow when you have:**
- Multiple related features to implement
- A roadmap spanning several weeks/months
- Features that share context or build on each other
- Need for prioritization across multiple initiatives

**For single work packages:** Use the [Work Package Workflow](_work-package.md) directly.

> **Key Principle:** This workflow handles **coordination and planning**. Individual work packages are implemented using the [Work Package Workflow](_work-package.md).

---

## Workflow

### Rules

- **Agents must NOT proceed past checkpoints without user confirmation**
- **Ask, don't assume** - Clarify scope and priorities before planning
- **Summarize, then proceed** - Present findings before asking to continue
- **User controls priorities** - Never assume priority order without confirmation
- **Explicit approval** - Get clear "yes" or "proceed" before creating documents

### Overview

```
1. SCOPE ASSESSMENT (5-10m)
   ├─ Confirm this is a multi-work-package initiative
   ├─ Identify the work packages to be planned
   └─ 🛑 CHECKPOINT: "I've identified N work packages. Proceed with planning?"

2. PLANNING FOLDER SETUP (5-10m)
   ├─ Create planning folder (.engineering/artifacts/planning/YYYY-MM-DD-name/)
   ├─ Create START-HERE.md skeleton
   ├─ Create README.md skeleton
   └─ 🛑 CHECKPOINT: "Planning folder created. Proceed with analysis?"

3. ANALYSIS (20-45m) [If applicable]
   ├─ Completion Analysis (if continuing previous work)
   │   ├─ Review what was completed
   │   ├─ Identify remaining work
   │   └─ Document in 01-COMPLETION-ANALYSIS.md
   ├─ Context Analysis (if new initiative)
   │   ├─ Research codebase patterns
   │   ├─ Identify architectural considerations
   │   └─ Document in 02-CONTEXT-ANALYSIS.md
   └─ 🛑 CHECKPOINT: "Analysis complete. Does this context look correct?"

4. WORK PACKAGE PLANNING (15-30m per WP)
   ├─ For each work package:
   │   ├─ Define scope (in/out)
   │   ├─ Identify dependencies
   │   ├─ Estimate effort
   │   ├─ Define success criteria
   │   └─ Create NN-feature-plan.md
   └─ 🛑 CHECKPOINT: "Work package plans created. Ready for prioritization?"

5. PRIORITIZATION (10-15m)
   ├─ Propose priority order based on:
   │   ├─ Dependencies (what blocks what)
   │   ├─ Business value (impact)
   │   ├─ Risk (technical uncertainty)
   │   └─ Effort (quick wins vs large efforts)
   ├─ Create dependency graph
   └─ 🛑 CHECKPOINT: "Here's the proposed priority order. Adjust as needed?"

6. FINALIZE ROADMAP (10-15m)
   ├─ Update START-HERE.md with final content
   ├─ Update README.md with navigation
   ├─ Add timeline estimates
   ├─ Document overall success criteria
   └─ 🛑 CHECKPOINT: "Roadmap complete. Ready to begin implementation?"

7. IMPLEMENTATION (ongoing)
   ├─ Select first work package by priority
   ├─ Follow [Work Package Workflow](_work-package.md)
   ├─ After completion, return here
   ├─ Update roadmap status
   └─ Select next work package
```

## Phase 1: Scope Assessment

Confirm this initiative requires multi-work-package planning.

### 1.1 Identify Work Packages

**Questions to answer:**
- What are the distinct features/capabilities to deliver?
- Are they related (shared context, dependencies)?
- Would they benefit from coordinated planning?

### 1.2 🛑 Scope Assessment Checkpoint

```markdown
## 📋 Scope Assessment

I've identified **N work packages** for this initiative:

1. **[Work Package 1]** - [Brief description]
2. **[Work Package 2]** - [Brief description]
3. **[Work Package 3]** - [Brief description]

**Rationale for grouping:**
- [Why these belong together]

**Estimated total effort:** X-Y hours agentic + Z hours review

---
**Proceed with multi-work-package planning?**
```

---

## Phase 2: Planning Folder Setup

Create the structured folder for planning artifacts.

### 2.1 Create Folder Structure

```bash
mkdir -p .engineering/artifacts/planning/YYYY-MM-DD-initiative-name
```

### 2.2 Create Skeleton Documents

Create initial START-HERE.md and README.md with placeholder content to be filled in during subsequent phases.

### 2.3 🛑 Folder Setup Checkpoint

```markdown
## 📁 Planning Folder Created

**Location:** `.engineering/artifacts/planning/YYYY-MM-DD-name/`

**Created:**
- [ ] START-HERE.md (skeleton)
- [ ] README.md (skeleton)

---
**Proceed with analysis phase?**
```

---

## Phase 3: Analysis

Gather context needed for informed planning.

### 3.1 Completion Analysis (if continuing work)

If this roadmap continues previous work, document:
- What was completed (with PR/ADR links)
- What remains from previous plans
- Lessons learned

📄 **Output:** `01-COMPLETION-ANALYSIS.md`

### 3.2 Context Analysis (for new initiatives)

Research and document:
- Relevant codebase patterns
- Architectural considerations
- External constraints or dependencies

📄 **Output:** `02-CONTEXT-ANALYSIS.md`

### 3.3 🛑 Analysis Checkpoint

```markdown
## 📊 Analysis Summary

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]

### Implications for Planning
- [How this affects work package scope/approach]

### Questions Resolved
- [Question 1]: [Answer]

### Open Questions
- [Question needing user input]

---
**Does this analysis look correct? Any additional context needed?**
```

---

## Phase 4: Work Package Planning

Create detailed plan for each work package.

### 4.1 For Each Work Package

1. **Define scope** - What's in, what's out
2. **Identify dependencies** - What blocks this, what does this enable
3. **Estimate effort** - Agentic time + review time
4. **Define success criteria** - Measurable outcomes
5. **Create plan document** - Using template below

📄 **Output:** `NN-feature-plan.md` for each work package

### 4.2 🛑 Work Package Plans Checkpoint

```markdown
## 📋 Work Package Plans Created

| # | Work Package | Effort | Dependencies |
|---|--------------|--------|--------------|
| 03 | [Feature A] | X-Yh | None |
| 04 | [Feature B] | X-Yh | Depends on 03 |
| 05 | [Feature C] | X-Yh | Depends on 03 |

**Total planned:** N work packages

---
**Ready to prioritize?**
```

---

## Phase 5: Prioritization

Establish implementation order.

### 5.1 Prioritization Factors

Consider:
- **Dependencies** - What must come first?
- **Business value** - What has highest impact?
- **Risk** - What has technical uncertainty?
- **Quick wins** - What can build momentum?

### 5.2 🛑 Prioritization Checkpoint

```markdown
## 🎯 Proposed Priority Order

| Priority | Phase | Work Package | Effort | Rationale |
|----------|-------|--------------|--------|-----------|
| 🔴 HIGH | 03 | [Feature A] | X-Yh | [Why first] |
| 🔴 HIGH | 04 | [Feature B] | X-Yh | [Why high] |
| 🟠 MEDIUM | 05 | [Feature C] | X-Yh | [Why medium] |
| 🟡 LOW | 06 | [Feature D] | X-Yh | [Why lower] |

**Dependency Graph:**
```
03 ──┬──► 04
     │
     └──► 05 ──► 06
```

---
**Adjust priorities as needed. Confirm when ready to finalize.**
```

2. 🟠 MEDIUM: Phase 3 (Observability) - Operations need
3. 🟠 MEDIUM: Phase 6 (Resilience) - Stability
4. 🟡 LOW: Phase 7 (DB Optimization) - Future scaling

### Implementation Order
Features implemented one at a time following priority, with commits after each task.

## Tips for Effective Planning

### Grouping Features

**Good reasons to group:**
- Share common context or domain
- Build on each other (dependencies)
- Part of same initiative/quarter
- Similar technical area

**Don't group if:**
- Completely unrelated features
- Different teams/owners
- Very different timelines
- No shared context

### Sizing Features

**Right-sized feature:**
- Takes 2-8 hours agentic time
- Has 3-6 concrete tasks
- Clear success criteria
- Can be implemented in one session

**Too large:**
- Split into multiple phases
- Each phase becomes a feature

**Too small:**
- Combine related small items
- May not need full planning

### Time Estimates

**Be realistic:**
- Include review time separately
- Account for testing time
- Add buffer for unknowns
- Track actuals for calibration

**Format:** `X-Yh agentic + Zh review`
- X-Y: Range for AI-assisted coding
- Z: Human review and feedback

- **v1.1** (2026-01): Refactored to reference _work-package.md instead of duplicating implementation details
- **v1.0** (2025-11-24): Initial version split from combined workflow

**Related:** [Work Package Workflow](_work-package.md) for implementing individual work packages
