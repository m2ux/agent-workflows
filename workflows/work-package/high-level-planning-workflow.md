# High-Level Planning Workflow

**Version:** 1.0  
**Last Updated:** November 24, 2025  
**Purpose:** Create comprehensive planning sessions that organize multiple features into an actionable roadmap

---

## Overview

This workflow defines how to create high-level planning sessions that organize multiple related features. Each planning session produces a structured folder with analysis, feature plans, and prioritization.

**Use this workflow when you have:**
- Multiple related features to implement
- A roadmap spanning several weeks/months
- Features that share context or build on each other
- Need for prioritization across multiple initiatives

**Not needed for:**
- Quick bug fix (<30 min)
- Minor refactoring with clear scope

> **Note:** Even single features should use the folder pattern for consistency. The [WP Implementation Workflow](_workflow.md) uses the same folder structure - this ensures all planning artifacts follow a unified pattern.

**Related:** After planning, use the [WP Implementation Workflow](_workflow.md) to implement individual features.

---

## Planning Folder Structure

### Location Pattern
```
.engineering/artifacts/planning/YYYY-MM-DD-descriptive-name/
```

**Examples:**
- `.engineering/artifacts/planning/2025-11-23-integrated-roadmap/`
- `.engineering/artifacts/planning/2025-12-01-performance-initiative/`
- `.engineering/artifacts/planning/2025-12-15-api-redesign/`

**Naming Conventions:**
- Use date prefix (YYYY-MM-DD) for chronological ordering
- Descriptive name (roadmap, initiative, sprint, project name)
- Kebab-case (lowercase with hyphens)

### Standard Structure

```
.engineering/artifacts/planning/YYYY-MM-DD-name/

2. 🟠 MEDIUM: Phase 3 (Observability) - Operations need
3. 🟠 MEDIUM: Phase 6 (Resilience) - Stability
4. 🟡 LOW: Phase 7 (DB Optimization) - Future scaling

### Implementation Order
Features implemented one at a time following priority, with commits after each task.

## Tips for Effective Planning

### Grouping Features

**Good reasons to group:**
- Share common context or domain
- Build on each other (dependencies)
- Part of same initiative/quarter
- Similar technical area

**Don't group if:**
- Completely unrelated features
- Different teams/owners
- Very different timelines
- No shared context

### Sizing Features

**Right-sized feature:**
- Takes 2-8 hours agentic time
- Has 3-6 concrete tasks
- Clear success criteria
- Can be implemented in one session

**Too large:**
- Split into multiple phases
- Each phase becomes a feature

**Too small:**
- Combine related small items
- May not need full planning

### Time Estimates

**Be realistic:**
- Include review time separately
- Account for testing time
- Add buffer for unknowns
- Track actuals for calibration

**Format:** `X-Yh agentic + Zh review`
- X-Y: Range for AI-assisted coding
- Z: Human review and feedback
