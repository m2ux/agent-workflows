# Work Package Implementation Workflow
## Overview

This workflow defines how to plan and implement ONE work package from inception to merged PR. A **work package** is a discrete unit of work such as a feature, bug-fix, enhancement, refactoring, or any other deliverable change.

**For multiple related work packages:** Use the [Work Packages Workflow](_work-packages.md) to create a roadmap first.

---

## Workflow
### Rules
- **Agents must NOT proceed past checkpoints without user confirmation**.
- **Ask, don't assume** - Clarify requirements before acting
- **Summarize, then proceed** - Provide brief status before asking to continue
- **One task at a time** - Complete current work before starting new work
- **Explicit approval** - Get clear "yes" or "proceed" before major actions

### Overview
```
1. ISSUE VERIFICATION & PR CREATION (10-20m)
   ├─ Check if GitHub or Jira issue specified
   ├─ 🛑 CHECKPOINT: "No issue found. Should I create one?"

    └─ Select next work package
```

## Phase 1: Issue Verification & PR Creation

**Every work package should be linked to a GitHub or Jira issue.** Issues define the problem space and provide traceability from requirements through implementation. The draft PR is created early with an initial changelog to establish the work package.

### 1.1 Check for Existing Issue

Before starting any work, verify whether an issue has been specified:

**Sources to check:**
- User explicitly provided issue number (e.g., "Implement #51")
- User linked to issue URL (e.g., "https://github.com/org/repo/issues/51")
- Jira ticket reference (e.g., "PROJ-123")
- Issue mentioned in context or conversation

### 1.2 🛑 Issue Verification Checkpoint

If no issue is found, **STOP and ask the user:**

```markdown
## 🎫 Issue Verification

I didn't find a GitHub or Jira issue associated with this work package.

**Issues provide:**
- Clear problem definition (what's broken/missing)
- Acceptance criteria (how we know it's done)
- Traceability (PR → Issue → Requirements)
- Stakeholder visibility

**Options:**
1. **Provide existing issue** - Share the issue number or URL
2. **Create new issue** - I'll help draft one using the Issue Creation Guide
3. **Skip issue** - Proceed without (not recommended for non-trivial work)

---
**Which option would you like?**
```

### 1.3 Creating a New Issue

📄 **Reference:** Follow the [Issue Creation Guide](github-issue-creation.guide.md) for template, methodology, and rules about problem-focused (not solution-focused) issues.

**Issue Creation Process:**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 1. Draft Problem Statement          │
│    - What's broken/missing?         │
│    - Current vs desired state       │
└────────────┬────────────────────────┘
             │
┌────────────▼────────────────────────┐
│ 2. Define Scope                     │
│    - In scope items                 │
│    - Out of scope items             │
└────────────┬────────────────────────┘
             │
┌────────────▼────────────────────────┐
│ 3. Write User Stories               │
│    - As a [user], I want [X]        │
│    - Acceptance criteria            │
└────────────┬────────────────────────┘
             │
┌────────────▼────────────────────────┐
│ 🛑 CHECKPOINT: Review with User     │
└────────────┬────────────────────────┘
             │
┌────────────▼────────────────────────┐
│ 4. Create GitHub Issue              │
│    - Use gh api or gh issue create  │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Creating the issue:**

```bash
# Write issue body to temp file
cat > /tmp/issue-body.md << 'EOF'
[Issue content following Issue Creation Guide template]
EOF

# Create issue using GitHub CLI
gh issue create --title "Issue Title" --body "$(cat /tmp/issue-body.md)"

# Or using API (preferred for complex content)
gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/issues -X POST \
  -f title="Issue Title" \
  -f body="$(cat /tmp/issue-body.md)"
```

### 1.4 🛑 Issue Created Checkpoint

After creating the issue, **confirm with user:**

```markdown
## ✅ Issue Created

**Issue:** #[number] - [Title]
**URL:** https://github.com/OWNER/REPO/issues/[number]

**Summary:**
- **Problem:** [One sentence]
- **Goal:** [One sentence]
- **Scope:** [Key items]

---
**Proceed to create feature branch and initial PR?**
```

### 1.5 Create Feature Branch

**Create the feature branch immediately after issue verification:**

```bash
# Ensure you're on main and up to date
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Create feature branch
git checkout -b type/work-package-name
```

**Branch naming convention:**

| Type | Pattern | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| Feature | `feat/work-package-name` | `feat/add-concept-caching` |
| Bug fix | `fix/bug-description` | `fix/search-null-pointer` |
| Refactor | `refactor/component-name` | `refactor/query-builder` |
| Performance | `perf/optimization-name` | `perf/index-lookup-speed` |
| Documentation | `docs/topic-name` | `docs/api-reference-update` |

### 1.6 Add Initial Changelog

**Create a changelog file in `changes/changed/` that references the issue:**

**Naming convention:** `{issue-number}-{brief-description}.md`

**Example:** `changes/changed/51-add-concept-caching.md`

```markdown
# [Brief Title]

## Summary

[One sentence describing the change]

## Issue

Fixes #[number]

## Type

[Feature | Bug Fix | Enhancement | Refactor | Documentation]
```

**Commit the changelog:**

```bash
git add changes/changed/
git commit -m "docs: add changelog for #[number]"
```

### 1.7 Create Draft PR

**Create the draft PR with the changelog as the initial content:**

```bash
# Push branch
git push -u origin type/work-package-name

# Create draft PR and assign
gh pr create --draft --assignee {GITHUB_USERNAME} \
  --title "type: Work Package Name" \
  --body "## 🎫 Issue

Fixes #[number]

## Status

🚧 Planning in progress

## Changelog

See \`changes/changed/[number]-description.md\`
"
```

**Why create PR early?**
- Establishes the work package immediately
- Provides visibility to stakeholders
- Links issue and PR early for traceability
- All subsequent commits are tracked

### 1.8 🛑 PR Created Checkpoint

After creating the PR, **confirm with user and ask about requirements elicitation:**

```markdown
## ✅ PR Created

**PR:** #[number] - [Title]
**Issue:** #[issue-number] - [Issue Title]

The PR is now linked to the issue. Next steps are research (Phase 3) and 
planning (Phase 4) to determine the approach, followed by implementation 
(Phases 5-9) to complete the work.

---

### Do you need requirements elicitation?

Requirements elicitation (Phase 2) is a structured conversation to discover 
and clarify what the work package should accomplish. It's useful when:

- ✅ Requirements are unclear or incomplete
- ✅ Scope needs to be explicitly defined (in/out lists)
- ✅ Multiple stakeholders have different needs
- ✅ Success criteria need to be established

It can be skipped when:
- ⏭️ Requirements are already well-defined in the issue
- ⏭️ The problem and solution are straightforward
- ⏭️ Scope is clear and unambiguous

**Options:**
1. **Yes, elicit requirements** - Proceed to Phase 2 (Requirements Elicitation)
2. **No, skip elicitation** - Proceed to research decision

**Which would you prefer?**
```

### 1.9 Issue Verification Checklist

- [ ] Checked for existing GitHub/Jira issue
- [ ] 🛑 **Asked user if no issue found**
- [ ] Issue created (if needed) following [Issue Creation Guide](github-issue-creation.guide.md)
- [ ] 🛑 **Issue confirmed with user**
- [ ] Feature branch created with correct naming
- [ ] Changelog added to `changes/changed/`
- [ ] Draft PR created linking to issue
- [ ] 🛑 **PR confirmed and elicitation decision obtained from user**

---

## Phase 2: Requirements Elicitation

**Discover and clarify what the work package should accomplish through structured conversation.** This phase ensures requirements are explicitly captured before planning the approach.

> **Note:** The user decides whether elicitation is needed at the Phase 1.8 checkpoint. If skipping, proceed directly to Phase 3 (Implementation Analysis). The issue from Phase 1 serves as the requirements source.

### 2.1 Elicitation Process

📄 **Reference:** Follow the [Requirements Elicitation Guide](requirements-elicitation.guide.md) for the full methodology, question bank, and templates.

**Process overview:**
1. Explore problem through sequential conversation (one question at a time)
2. Identify stakeholders and context
3. Define scope boundaries (in/out lists)
4. Establish success criteria
5. Confirm with user at checkpoint

**Output:** `.engineering/artifacts/planning/YYYY-MM-DD-work-package-name/00-requirements-elicitation.md`

### 2.2 🛑 Requirements Elicitation Checkpoint

After exploring requirements, **STOP and confirm with user** using the checkpoint template from the guide.

### 2.3 Requirements Elicitation Checklist

- [ ] User confirmed elicitation is needed (Phase 1.8 checkpoint)
- [ ] Problem explored through conversation
- [ ] Stakeholders and context identified
- [ ] Scope boundaries defined (in/out lists)
- [ ] Success criteria established
- [ ] 🛑 **Requirements confirmed with user**
- [ ] `00-requirements-elicitation.md` created

---

## Phase 3: Implementation Analysis

**Analyze the current implementation** to understand effectiveness, establish baselines, and identify opportunities for improvement. This phase always occurs to ensure the planning phase has necessary context.

> **Note:** If requirements were elicited in Phase 2, use them as context for analysis. If elicitation was skipped, use the issue from Phase 1 as context.

### 3.1 Analysis Process

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 1. Analyze Current Implementation   │
│    - How is it currently used?      │
│    - What are baseline metrics?     │
│    - Is it effective? (evidence)    │
│    - What gaps/opportunities exist? │
└────────────┬────────────────────────┘
             │
┌────────────▼────────────────────────┐
│ 2. Document Findings                │
│    - Create analysis document       │
│    - Establish baseline metrics     │
└────────────┬────────────────────────┘
             │
┌────────────▼────────────────────────┐
│ 🛑 CHECKPOINT: Research Decision    │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 3.2 Implementation Analysis

📄 **Reference:** [Implementation Analysis Guide](implementation-analysis.guide.md) — Full methodology, templates, and checkpoint format.

**Output:** `.engineering/artifacts/planning/YYYY-MM-DD-work-package-name/01-implementation-analysis.md`

**Analysis should cover:**
- Current usage patterns and behavior
- Baseline metrics with evidence
- Effectiveness assessment
- Gaps and opportunities for improvement
- Constraints and limitations

### 3.3 🛑 Research Decision Checkpoint

**After completing implementation analysis, ask about research:**

```markdown
## 📊 Implementation Analysis Complete

**Key Findings:**
- [Summary of current state]
- [Baseline metrics established]
- [Gaps/opportunities identified]

---

## 🔬 Research Decision

Would you like me to perform additional research before planning?

Research (Phase 4) gathers knowledge base insights and web research to inform 
the planning phase. It's useful when:

- ✅ The problem domain is unfamiliar or complex
- ✅ Best practices or design patterns should be discovered
- ✅ External libraries, tools, or approaches may be relevant
- ✅ You want evidence-based recommendations

It can be skipped when:

- ⏭️ The problem domain is well-understood
- ⏭️ The solution approach is already clear
- ⏭️ No external research or pattern discovery is needed

**Options:**
1. **Yes, perform research** - Proceed to Phase 4 (Research)
2. **No, skip to planning** - Proceed directly to Phase 5 (Plan & Prepare)

**Which would you prefer?**
```

### 3.4 Implementation Analysis Checklist

- [ ] Current implementation analyzed
- [ ] Baseline metrics established with evidence
- [ ] Gaps and opportunities identified
- [ ] `01-implementation-analysis.md` created
- [ ] 🛑 **Research decision obtained from user**

---

Research the knowledge base to discover best practices, patterns, and external resources to inform the planning phase.

> **Note:** Implementation analysis has already been completed in Phase 3. Use those findings as context for research.

### 4.1 When to Perform Research

**The user decides whether research is needed** at the Phase 3.3 checkpoint. This decision was made after completing implementation analysis.

> **If skipping:** Proceed directly to Phase 5 (Plan & Prepare). Use the implementation analysis findings from Phase 3 as context for planning.

### 4.2 Research Process

### 4.3 Knowledge Base Research

Before designing an approach, **research the knowledge base** using concept-rag MCP tools to discover relevant concepts, best practices, and design patterns.

**⚠️ MANDATORY:** Call `get_guidance` before making other concept-rag MCP tool calls.

📄 **Reference:** [Knowledge Base Research Guide](knowledge-base-research.guide.md) — Full methodology, templates, and checkpoint format.

**Output:** `.engineering/artifacts/planning/YYYY-MM-DD-work-package-name/02-kb-research.md`

### 4.4 🛑 Knowledge Base Insights Checkpoint

After researching, **STOP and present findings** using the checkpoint template from the guide above.

### 4.5 Web Research

**Research external sources** to discover industry best practices, relevant libraries, and similar implementations.

**Areas to research:**
- Industry best practices for the problem domain
- Relevant libraries, frameworks, or tools
- Similar implementations in open source projects
- Official documentation and tutorials
- Recent articles or blog posts on the topic

**Use the `web_search` tool** to find current information.

**Output:** Add web research findings to `.engineering/artifacts/planning/YYYY-MM-DD-work-package-name/02-kb-research.md` (or create separate `02b-web-research.md` if extensive).

### 4.6 🛑 Web Research Checkpoint

After web research, **STOP and present findings:**

```markdown
## 🌐 Web Research Findings

**Search Topics:**
1. [Topic 1] - [What was searched]
2. [Topic 2] - [What was searched]

**Key Findings:**

### Best Practices
- [Finding 1] - [Source]
- [Finding 2] - [Source]

### Relevant Libraries/Tools
- [Library 1] - [Brief description, relevance]
- [Library 2] - [Brief description, relevance]

### Similar Implementations
- [Example 1] - [What's relevant]

### Documentation/Resources
- [Resource 1] - [Link/reference]

**Recommendations:**
- [How these findings should inform the approach]

---
**Are these external resources relevant? Any additional areas to research?**
```

### 4.7 Research Checklist

- [ ] User confirmed research is needed (Phase 3.3 checkpoint)
- [ ] `get_guidance` called at start of KB research session (MANDATORY)
- [ ] Knowledge base researched → `02-kb-research.md`
- [ ] 🛑 **Knowledge insights confirmed with user**
- [ ] Web research completed (best practices, libraries, examples)
- [ ] 🛑 **Web research findings confirmed with user**

---

## Phase 5: Plan & Prepare

Design the approach, create the work package plan, and prepare for implementation.

> **Note:** The feature branch and draft PR were created in Phase 1.

### 5.1 When Planning is Required

**Always plan when:**
- Work package has 3+ distinct tasks
- Multiple files or components affected
- Architectural decisions needed
- Performance targets must be met

**Skip formal planning when:**
- Simple, well-understood bug fix
- Single file change with clear requirements
- Change can be completed in <30 minutes

### 5.2 Design Framework

**Consult the Design Framework Guide** before designing the approach to structure problem-solving and identify solution strategies.

📄 **Reference:** [Design Framework Guide](design-framework.guide.md)

**The framework helps you:**
- Define the problem clearly before jumping to solutions
- Classify the problem type to select the right approach
- Explore conventional solutions first (design patterns, best practices)
- Apply inventive principles when trade-offs or contradictions exist
- Synthesize and document the final design

> **Note:** For straightforward implementations, a lightweight application focusing on problem definition and conventional solutions may suffice. Apply the full framework for complex problems with trade-offs.

### 5.3 Planning Process

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 0. Apply Design Framework           │
│    - Problem definition             │

             │
┌────────────▼────────────────────────┐
│ 🛑 CHECKPOINT: Ready to Implement   │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 5.4 Approach Checkpoint

After designing the approach, **STOP and confirm:**

```markdown
## 🎯 Proposed Approach

**Solution Overview:** [2-3 sentences]

**Key Components:**
1. [Component/change 1]
2. [Component/change 2]

**Alternatives Considered:**
- Option A: [Brief] - [Why not chosen]

**Trade-offs:**
- Pro: [Benefit]
- Con: [Limitation]

**Estimated Effort:** X-Yh agentic + Zh review

---
**Does this approach look right?**
```

### 5.5 Work Package Plan Folder

> **Note:** Always use the folder pattern for consistency with [Work Packages Workflow](_work-packages.md). Even simple work packages benefit from the structured navigation.

**Location:** `.engineering/artifacts/planning/YYYY-MM-DD-work-package-name/`

**Structure:**
```
.engineering/artifacts/planning/YYYY-MM-DD-work-package-name/
├── START-HERE.md              # Executive summary (required) - includes issue link
├── README.md                  # Quick navigation (required)
├── 00-requirements-elicitation.md  # Elicited requirements (if requested)
├── 03-work-package-plan.md    # Detailed implementation plan (required)
├── 02-kb-research.md          # Knowledge base research findings (recommended)
├── 01-implementation-analysis.md  # Current implementation analysis (recommended)
└── 05-assumptions-log.md      # Assumptions and outcomes (created during implementation)
```

> **Issue Reference:** The `START-HERE.md` should include the issue link from Phase 1 (e.g., `**Issue:** [#51](https://github.com/OWNER/REPO/issues/51)`).

**For complex work packages**, add additional files as needed:
```
.engineering/artifacts/planning/YYYY-MM-DD-work-package-name/
├── START-HERE.md
├── README.md
├── 00-requirements-elicitation.md  # Elicited requirements (features only, see guide)
├── 03-work-package-plan.md    # Implementation plan
├── 02-kb-research.md          # KB research (see Knowledge Base Research Guide)
├── 01-implementation-analysis.md  # Analysis (see Implementation Analysis Guide)
├── 05-assumptions-log.md      # Assumptions made and outcomes (see below)
└── 04-test-plan.md         # Detailed testing (if needed)
```

---

#### START-HERE.md

📄 **Reference:** Follow the [Work Package START-HERE](start-here.guide.md) for the full template and guidelines.

---

#### README.md

📄 **Reference:** Follow the [Work Package README](readme.guide.md) for the full template and guidelines.

---

#### 03-work-package-plan.md

📄 **Reference:** Follow the [Work Package Plan](plan.guide.md) for the full template and guidelines.

---

#### 05-assumptions-log.md

📄 **Reference:** Follow the [Assumptions Guide](assumptions-review.guide.md) for assumption categories, review process, and log template.

### 5.6 Sync Feature Branch with Main

**Ensure the feature branch is up to date with main before starting implementation:**

```bash
# Switch to feature branch (created in Phase 1)
git checkout type/work-package-name

# Pull latest from main
git fetch origin main
git rebase origin/main

# Or merge if preferred
# git merge origin/main
```

**Verification:**

```bash
# Confirm you're on the correct branch
git branch --show-current
# Should output: type/work-package-name (NOT main or master)
```

### 5.7 Create Test Plan (Recommended)

**Create a test plan when the work package has multiple testable behaviors.**

The test plan documents how the work package's requirements will be validated. At this stage, create a **placeholder** test plan—detailed test cases and source links will be added after implementation.

**Steps:**

1. Create test plan file: `docs/tests/test-plan-work-package-name.md`
2. Use the **Initial Test Plan Template** (placeholder without source links)
3. List planned test objectives (implementation details come later)

📄 **Reference:** Follow the [Test Plan Creation Guide](test-plan.guide.md) for templates, TDD principles, and guidelines.

> **Note:** The test plan will be finalized in Phase 7 (Finalize) after implementation is complete, adding hyperlinks to actual test locations.

### 5.8 Update PR Description

**Update the PR description with the plan summary.** The PR was created in Phase 1 with just the changelog; now add implementation details.

```bash
# Update PR description using GitHub API
gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/pulls/PR_NUMBER -X PATCH \
  -f body="$(cat /tmp/pr-body.md)"
```

**PR description should now include:**

```markdown
## 🎫 Issue

Fixes #[issue-number]

## Summary

[Brief description of what this PR implements]

## Approach

[Key design decisions from Phase 4 planning]

## Tasks

- [ ] Task 1: [Description]
- [ ] Task 2: [Description]
- [ ] Task 3: [Description]

## Changelog

See `changes/changed/[number]-description.md`

## Status

🚧 Implementation in progress
```

📄 **Reference:** Follow the [PR Description Guide](pr-description.guide.md) for the full template.

### 5.9 Create TODO List

Extract tasks from work package plan. Create one TODO per task.

**TODO Management:**
- Mark only ONE as `in_progress` at a time
- Update to `completed` immediately after finishing
- Use descriptive names matching plan

### 5.10 🛑 Ready to Implement Checkpoint

Before starting implementation, **present the plan summary:**

```markdown
## ✅ Ready to Implement

## Phase 6: Implement Tasks

### 6.0 Pre-Implementation Branch Verification

**Before writing any code, verify you're on the correct feature branch:**

```bash
# Check current branch
git branch --show-current

# Expected: type/work-package-name (e.g., feat/add-concept-caching)
# NOT: main, master, or any other branch
```

⚠️ **Do NOT proceed with implementation until you're on the correct feature branch.**

### 6.1 Task Implementation Pattern

```
FOR EACH TASK:
  0. Verify on feature branch (NOT main/master)
         │
  1. Read task spec (goal, deliverables)
         │
  2. Implement (bottom-up, follow existing patterns)
         │
  3. Test immediately (100% coverage of new code)
         │
  4. Commit with clear message
         │
  5. Update TODO (mark completed, next in_progress)
         │
  6. Review assumptions made during implementation
         │
  7. 🛑 Report progress + assumptions to user
         │
  8. Document assumptions + outcomes in 05-assumptions-log.md

AFTER ALL TASKS COMPLETE:
  9. Code review (language-specific)
         │
  10. 🛑 Report review findings to user
         │
  11. Verify architectural significance
         │
  12. Create ADR (if significant)
```

### 6.2 Assumption Review

**After completing each task, explicitly identify assumptions made during implementation.**

**Preferred approach:** Use the interview-style review, presenting assumptions one at a time with numbered alternatives for the user to choose from.

📄 **Reference:** Follow the [Assumptions Guide](assumptions-review.guide.md) for the interview format, assumption categories, self-review questions, and the log template.

### 6.3 Code Quality Checklist

- [ ] Follows existing patterns and architecture
- [ ] Type-safe (compiler checks pass)
- [ ] Error handling implemented
- [ ] No hardcoded values
- [ ] Documentation comments on public APIs
- [ ] No debug prints in production code

### 6.4 Testing as You Code

**Don't defer testing - write tests alongside implementation:**

1. Write interface/type signature
2. Write basic test
3. Implement to pass test
4. Add edge case tests
5. Implement to pass all tests
6. Refactor if needed (tests protect you)

**Language-specific test commands:**

| Language | Run Tests | Run Single Test |
|----------|-----------|-----------------|
| Rust | `cargo test` | `cargo test test_name` |
| TypeScript | `npm test` | `npm test -- path/to/test` |
| Python | `pytest` | `pytest path/to/test.py` |

### 6.5 Commit Strategy

**Commit after each task** following the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification.

#### Commit Message Format

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

**Rules:**
- **Description** must be 50 characters or less
- **Body** (if present) must be separated by a blank line
- **Footer** (if present) must be separated by a blank line from body

#### Types

| Type | When to Use | SemVer Impact |
|------|-------------|---------------|
| `feat` | New feature or capability | MINOR |
| `fix` | Bug fix | PATCH |
| `docs` | Documentation only | None |
| `style` | Formatting, no code change | None |
| `refactor` | Code change that neither fixes nor adds | None |
| `perf` | Performance improvement | None |
| `test` | Adding or correcting tests | None |
| `build` | Build system or dependencies | None |
| `ci` | CI configuration | None |
| `chore` | Other changes (e.g., tooling) | None |

#### Breaking Changes

Indicate breaking changes using `!` after type/scope OR with a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer:

```
feat(api)!: remove deprecated endpoints

BREAKING CHANGE: The /v1/users endpoint has been removed. Use /v2/users instead.
```

#### Scope (Optional)

Use scope to indicate the affected component:

```
feat(search): add hybrid scoring mode
fix(ingestion): handle empty documents
refactor(api): simplify error handling
```

#### Examples

**Simple commit:**
```
feat: add BM25 keyword scoring
```

**Commit with scope:**
```
fix(search): handle null query parameters
```

**Commit with body:**
```
feat(fusion): implement reciprocal rank fusion

Combines vector similarity and BM25 scores using RRF algorithm.
Uses k=60 constant for score normalization.

Refs: #123
```

**Commit with footer referencing work package:**
```
refactor(scoring): extract score normalization utilities

Move normalization logic to dedicated module for reuse
across different scoring strategies.

WP: Hybrid Search Implementation (Task 2)
```

### 6.6 Task Completion Checklist

- [ ] Implementation matches plan
- [ ] Unit tests written (100% of new code)
- [ ] ✅ All unit tests passing
- [ ] ✅ All integration tests passing
- [ ] ✅ All e2e tests passing
- [ ] Build succeeds
- [ ] Documentation comments on public APIs
- [ ] Committed with clear message
- [ ] TODO marked as `completed`
- [ ] Assumptions documented and reported to user
- [ ] 🛑 **User confirmed assumptions or corrections applied**
- [ ] Assumptions and outcomes recorded in `05-assumptions-log.md`

**⚠️ Do NOT mark a task complete if any tests are failing.**

### 6.7 🛑 Task Progress & Assumption Review Checkpoint

After each task, **STOP and report progress and assumptions.**

> **Note:** For assumption review, prefer the **interview-style approach** (one assumption at a time with alternatives) described in the [Assumptions Guide](assumptions-review.guide.md). The batch format below is an alternative when assumptions are straightforward.

```markdown
## ✅ Task N Complete

**What was done:**
- [Summary of implementation]
- [Key decisions made]

**Files changed:**
- `src/path/to/module` - [Description]
- `tests/...` - [X tests]

**Test Results:**
- ✅ Unit tests: X/X passing (including Y new tests)
- ✅ Integration tests: X/X passing
- ✅ E2E tests: X/X passing
- ✅ Build successful

**Committed:** `abc123` - "feat: [message]"

---

### 🔍 Assumptions Made

**⚠️ The following assumptions were made during implementation. Please review and confirm or correct before proceeding.**

#### Design Decisions

| Decision | Assumption Made | Alternatives Considered |
|----------|-----------------|------------------------|
| [e.g., Error handling] | [e.g., Return Result<T> instead of panicking] | [e.g., Could use Option<T>, could panic] |
| [e.g., Data structure] | [e.g., Used HashMap for O(1) lookup] | [e.g., Could use Vec with linear search] |

#### Behavioral Assumptions

- **[Category]:** [Assumption] — [Rationale]
- **[Category]:** [Assumption] — [Rationale]

*Examples:*
- **Default value:** Empty string used when field is missing — assumed this matches existing behavior
- **Edge case:** Silently ignores duplicate entries — unclear if duplicates should error
- **Ordering:** Results returned in insertion order — no explicit requirement specified

#### Open Questions

1. [Any uncertainties that emerged during implementation]
2. [Decisions that could benefit from clarification]

#### Scope Decisions

- **Included:** [What was intentionally added beyond minimum]
- **Deferred:** [What was intentionally left for later]
- **Excluded:** [What was explicitly not done and why]

---
**Progress:** Task N of M complete (X% done)
**Next:** Task N+1 - [Name] (~Y min)

**Please review assumptions above.**
- ✅ Confirm assumptions are acceptable, OR
- 🔄 Provide corrections before continuing

**Continue to Task N+1?**
```

**⚠️ If any tests are failing, do NOT proceed to the next task. Fix failures first.**

**⚠️ Do NOT proceed until user has reviewed and confirmed assumptions.** If assumptions are incorrect, make necessary adjustments before moving on.

### 6.8 Updating the Assumptions Log

**After the user responds to the checkpoint**, update `05-assumptions-log.md`:

```markdown
## Task N: [Task Name]

**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD

### Assumptions Surfaced

| ID | Category | Assumption | Rationale |
|----|----------|------------|-----------|
| N.1 | [Category] | [Assumption made] | [Why this seemed reasonable] |
| N.2 | [Category] | [Assumption made] | [Why this seemed reasonable] |

### User Response

**Status:** ✅ Confirmed | 🔄 Corrected | ⏸️ Deferred

**Feedback:**
- [User's response to each assumption]

### Outcome

| ID | Original Assumption | Outcome | Changes Made |
|----|---------------------|---------|--------------|
| N.1 | [Assumption] | ✅ Confirmed | None required |
| N.2 | [Assumption] | 🔄 Corrected | [Description of changes] |

### Lessons Learned

- [Any insights for future tasks]
```

📄 **Reference:** See the [Assumptions Guide](assumptions-review.guide.md) for the log template.

### 6.9 Code Review (After All Tasks Complete)

**After completing all tasks**, perform a language-specific code review of all changes made during implementation.

#### Language Detection

Detect the primary language used based on:
- File extensions of modified files (`.rs`, `.ts`, `.py`, etc.)
- Project configuration files (`Cargo.toml`, `package.json`, `pyproject.toml`)
- Existing codebase patterns

#### Review Guide Selection

| Language | Review Guide | When to Use |
|----------|--------------|-------------|
| Rust/Substrate | [Rust/Substrate Review Guide](../general/rust-substrate-review-prompt.md) | Rust projects, especially Substrate-based blockchain code |
| TypeScript/JavaScript | *Guide not yet available* | Web/Node.js projects |
| Python | *Guide not yet available* | Python projects |

> **Note:** When a language-specific guide is not available, perform a general code review focusing on: code quality, error handling, test coverage, documentation, and adherence to project conventions.

#### Review Scope

The code review should cover:

1. **All changes made during implementation** (entire work package diff)
2. **Adherence to language idioms** and best practices
3. **Error handling** completeness and appropriateness
4. **Test coverage** of new/modified code
5. **Documentation** of public APIs and complex logic

#### 🛑 Code Review Checkpoint

After completing the review, **STOP and present findings:**

```markdown
## 🔬 Code Review Complete

**Language Detected:** [Rust/TypeScript/Python/Other]
**Review Guide Used:** [Guide name or "General review"]
**Files Reviewed:** [Count]

### Review Summary

| Severity | Count | Status |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Critical | X | [✅ Fixed / ⚠️ Needs action] |
| High | X | [✅ Fixed / ⚠️ Needs action] |
| Medium | X | [⚠️ Documented] |
| Low | X | [ℹ️ Documented] |

### Issues Found

**Issue #1: [Brief Title]** (Severity)
- **Location:** `file_path:line_numbers`
- **Description:** [Brief technical explanation]
- **Recommendation:** [Suggested fix]
- **Status:** [Fixed | Needs user decision]

### Strengths Observed

- [Notable positive patterns]

### Recommendations

1. [Any remaining suggestions]

---
**Critical/High issues must be addressed before proceeding.**
**Medium/Low issues: Address now or defer?**
```

**If Critical or High severity issues remain:** Address them before proceeding.

**If only Medium or Low severity issues remain:** User decides whether to address now or defer.

### 6.10 Verify Architectural Significance

**After all tasks are complete**, verify whether the implementation warrants an ADR before creating one.

**Rationale:** Not all work packages require ADRs. ADRs should document architecturally significant decisions—those that are difficult to reverse, affect system-wide quality attributes, or establish precedents for future decisions.

#### Architectural Significance Checklist

Use this checklist to determine if the work package warrants an ADR:

| Criterion | Check |
|-----------|-------|
| Affects multiple components? | ☐ |
| Involves quality attribute trade-offs? | ☐ |
| Establishes a pattern others will follow? | ☐ |
| Would be costly to reverse? | ☐ |
| Future developers need to understand why? | ☐ |
| Changes core abstractions or data models? | ☐ |

**Threshold:** If **3 or more** criteria are checked, create an ADR.

#### Quick Decision Guide

| Work Package Type | ADR Required? |
|-------------------|---------------|
| Major new feature with new capabilities | ✅ Yes |
| Architectural change affecting multiple components | ✅ Yes |
| New pattern, library, or framework introduction | ✅ Yes |
| Changes to core abstractions or data models | ✅ Yes |
| Bug fix (even complex multi-file) | ❌ No |
| Refactoring (internal improvements) | ❌ No |
| Minor feature (small enhancement, UI tweak) | ❌ No |
| Performance optimization (unless architectural) | ❌ No |
| Documentation update | ❌ No |

#### 🛑 Architectural Significance Checkpoint

After completing all tasks, **STOP and present the significance assessment:**

```markdown
## 🏛️ Architectural Significance Assessment

**Work Package:** [Name]

### Checklist Results

| Criterion | Result | Evidence |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| Affects multiple components? | [✅/❌] | [Brief evidence] |
| Involves quality attribute trade-offs? | [✅/❌] | [Brief evidence] |
| Establishes a pattern others will follow? | [✅/❌] | [Brief evidence] |
| Would be costly to reverse? | [✅/❌] | [Brief evidence] |
| Future developers need to understand why? | [✅/❌] | [Brief evidence] |
| Changes core abstractions or data models? | [✅/❌] | [Brief evidence] |

**Criteria Met:** X of 6
**Threshold:** 3 or more → Create ADR

### Recommendation

[✅ Create ADR | ❌ Skip ADR] because [brief rationale].

---
**Do you agree with this assessment? Should I [create/skip] the ADR?**
```

### 6.11 Create ADR (If Architecturally Significant)

**If the significance assessment indicates an ADR is warranted**, create one to document the architectural decisions made during implementation.

**Rationale:** Architectural decisions are not finalized until implementation is complete. Constraints encountered during implementation often require design changes. Creating the ADR after implementation ensures it captures the *actual* architecture, not the *planned* architecture.

#### ⚠️ CRITICAL: Never Modify Historical ADRs

**ADRs are immutable historical records.** They document the design decision *at the time it was made*.

- **NEVER modify existing ADRs** to reflect later changes
- **DO NOT update examples** in old ADRs when code changes
- If a decision is superseded, create a **new ADR** that references and supersedes the old one
- The new ADR's "Context" section should explain why the previous decision changed

**Rationale:** ADRs serve as an audit trail. Future developers need to understand what was decided and why, including decisions that were later changed. Modifying historical ADRs destroys this valuable context.

#### ADR Creation Steps

**Steps:**

1. Create ADR file: `.engineering/artifacts/adr/NNNN-work-package-name.md`
2. Set status to **Accepted** (since implementation is complete)
3. Document the actual architectural decisions made during implementation
4. Include **Consequences** section (positive, negative, neutral)
5. Commit with message: `docs(adr): add ADR for [work package name]`

📄 **Reference:** Follow the [Architecture Review Guide](architecture-review.guide.md) for full template, architectural significance criteria, and guidelines.

#### 🛑 ADR Checkpoint

After creating the ADR, **STOP and confirm with user:**

```markdown
## 📋 ADR Created

**ADR:** `.engineering/artifacts/adr/NNNN-work-package-name.md`
**Status:** Accepted

**Key Decisions Documented:**
1. [Decision 1] - [Brief rationale]
2. [Decision 2] - [Brief rationale]

**Alternatives Considered:**
- [Alternative 1] - [Why not chosen]

**Consequences:**
- Positive: [Key benefit]
- Negative: [Key trade-off accepted]

---
**Does this ADR accurately capture the architectural decisions made?**
```

---

## Phase 7: Testing & Validation

### 7.1 Continuous Testing

**After each task:**

```bash
# Run tests for current component
#    Rust:       cargo test module_name
#    TypeScript: npm test -- path/to/test
#    Python:     pytest path/to/test.py

# Run full test suite
#    Rust:       cargo test
#    TypeScript: npm test
#    Python:     pytest

# Verify build
#    Rust:       cargo build
#    TypeScript: npm run build
```

**If tests fail:** Fix immediately before moving on.

### 7.2 Test Levels

**⚠️ CRITICAL: ALL existing tests must pass before a work package is considered complete.**

This includes unit tests, integration tests, and e2e tests—regardless of whether the work package modified the code they cover.

#### Unit Tests (Always Required)

**Location:**
- Rust: `src/module/tests.rs` or `tests/module_test.rs`
- TypeScript: `src/**/__tests__/component.test.ts`
- Python: `tests/test_component.py`

**Coverage:** 100% of new code

**Categories to cover:**
- ✅ Normal/happy path
- ✅ Edge cases (empty, null/None, boundary values)
- ✅ Error conditions

#### Integration Tests (Required to Pass)

Test multiple components working together with real dependencies.

**Requirement:** All existing integration tests MUST pass. If the work package adds new integration points, add corresponding integration tests.

#### E2E Tests (Required to Pass)

Test complete workflows and validate end-to-end behavior.

**Requirement:** All existing e2e tests MUST pass. If the work package affects user-facing workflows, add or update e2e tests.

#### Performance Tests (If Applicable)

Validate performance targets when the work package has performance criteria.

### 7.3 Final Validation

**⚠️ MANDATORY: All tests must pass before creating a PR.**

Before creating PR, run the complete test suite:

```bash
# TypeScript/Node.js
npm test                    # All unit tests
npm run test:integration    # All integration tests (if available)
npm run test:e2e            # All e2e tests (if available)
npm run build               # Build verification
npm run lint                # Linter check

# Rust
cargo test                  # All tests (unit + integration)
cargo build                 # Build verification
cargo clippy                # Linter check

# Python
pytest                      # All tests
pytest tests/integration    # Integration tests
pytest tests/e2e            # E2E tests
```

**If ANY test fails:** Fix the issue before proceeding. Do NOT create a PR with failing tests.

### 7.4 Validation Checklist

**All items are REQUIRED for work package completion:**

- [ ] ✅ All unit tests pass (100% pass rate)
- [ ] ✅ All integration tests pass (100% pass rate)
- [ ] ✅ All e2e tests pass (100% pass rate)
- [ ] ✅ Build succeeds with no errors
- [ ] ✅ No new linter errors
- [ ] Performance targets met (if work package has performance criteria)
- [ ] All TODOs completed

**Test Failure Policy:**
- A work package is NOT complete if any test fails
- Fix failing tests before moving to documentation or PR creation
- If a test failure is unrelated to your changes, investigate and document the issue

---

## Phase 8: Finalize

> **Note:** This phase focuses on finalizing documentation after implementation is complete.

### 8.1 Update ADR Status (If Applicable)

**Skip this step if no ADR was created** (i.e., for bug fixes, refactoring, or minor features).

If an ADR was created in Phase 5, verify its status is **Accepted**:

```markdown
## Status

Accepted
```

Commit this change:

```bash
git commit -m "docs(adr): update ADR status to Accepted"
```

### 8.2 Finalize Test Plan

If a placeholder test plan was created in Phase 4, update it with implementation details:

**Steps:**

1. Add hyperlinks to Test IDs pointing to actual test locations (`#L<line>`)
2. Add hyperlinked symbols in the Overview section
3. Expand the table with Steps and Expected Result columns
4. Add verified Running Tests commands

📄 **Reference:** Use the **Final Test Plan Template** from the [Test Plan Creation Guide](test-plan.guide.md).

Commit with the ADR update or separately:

```bash
git commit -m "docs: finalize test plan with source links"
```

### 8.3 Work Package Completion Document

**Create:** `.engineering/artifacts/planning/YYYY-MM-DD-work-package-name/COMPLETE.md`

📄 **Reference:** Follow the [Work Package Completion](complete.guide.md) for the full template and guidelines.

### 8.4 Inline Documentation

Ensure documentation on all public APIs:

**Rust:**
```rust
/// Brief description.
///
/// # Arguments
/// * `param` - Description
///
/// # Returns
/// Description
pub fn function(param: Type) -> Result { ... }
```

**TypeScript:**
```typescript
/**
 * Brief description.
 * @param param - Description
 * @returns Description
 */
export function fn(param: Type): Result { ... }
```

---

## Phase 9: Update PR

> **Note:** The PR was created in Phase 1. This phase updates the PR description with final implementation details.

### 9.1 Pre-Finalization Verification

```bash
git branch --show-current    # On feature branch?
git status                   # Clean working directory?
git log origin/main..HEAD    # Review all commits
# Build and tests pass?
```

### 9.2 Push Final Changes

Ensure all commits are pushed:

```bash
git push origin type/work-package-name
```

### 9.3 Update PR Description

Update the PR description to reflect the completed implementation.

📄 **Reference:** Follow the [PR Description Guide](pr-description.guide.md) for the full template and section guidelines.

> **Important:** If an ADR exists, link to it on the *feature branch*, not main. Use the format:
> `https://github.com/OWNER/REPO/blob/BRANCH-NAME/.engineering/artifacts/adr/NNNN-name.md`
>
> Example: `**ADR:** [NNNN-work-package-name](https://github.com/{REPO_OWNER}/{REPO_NAME}/blob/feat/work-package-name/.engineering/artifacts/adr/NNNN-work-package-name.md)`
>
> Relative links like `.engineering/artifacts/adr/NNNN-name.md` resolve to main, which won't contain the ADR until the PR is merged.

**Updating the PR Description:**

Use the GitHub API directly instead of `gh pr edit` (which may fail due to GraphQL issues with Projects):

```bash
# Write the PR body to a file
cat > /tmp/pr-body.md << 'EOF'
[PR description content here]
EOF

# Update using GitHub API
gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/pulls/PR_NUMBER -X PATCH -f body="$(cat /tmp/pr-body.md)"
```

### 9.4 Mark PR Ready for Review

**Convert draft PR to ready for review:**

```bash
# Mark PR as ready for review
gh pr ready
```

### 9.5 🛑 PR Update Checkpoint

Before marking PR ready for review, **present to user:**

```markdown
## 📝 PR Ready for Review

**PR:** #[number]
**Title:** `type: Work Package Name`

**Updated Description:**
[Show the updated PR description]

---
**Ready to mark PR as ready for review?**
```

### 9.6 After PR Updated

Update WP-COMPLETE.md with final PR number and status.

---

## Phase 10: Post-Implementation

### 10.1 Capture Session History (Private)

**⚠️ PRIVATE DATA:** Chat history contains potentially sensitive session data. It must ONLY be stored in the private metadata location specified below. NEVER commit this data to the repository.

#### Prerequisite Check

**Before capturing history, verify the metadata folder exists and is a valid repository:**

```bash
# Check if metadata folder exists and is a git repository (submodule or worktree)
if [ -d ".engineering/agent/metadata" ] && [ -d ".engineering/agent/metadata/.git" -o -f ".engineering/agent/metadata/.git" ]; then
    echo "✅ Metadata repository found - proceed with history capture"
else
    echo "⏭️ Metadata repository not found - skipping history capture"
fi
```

**Skip history capture if:**
- `.engineering/agent/metadata/` folder does not exist
- `.engineering/agent/metadata/` is not a git submodule or worktree

> **Rationale:** History capture requires a dedicated private repository. Without proper repository setup, there's no safe location to store session data.

#### Location

```
.engineering/agent/metadata/projects/<project-name>/<work-package-name>/history/
```

**Structure:**
```
.engineering/agent/metadata/projects/
└── <project-name>/
    └── <work-package-name>/
        └── history/
            ├── session-YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM.md    # Session transcript
            └── summary.md                      # Session summary
```

**Session Transcript** (`session-YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM.md`):
- Complete chat history from the work package session
- Includes all agent-user exchanges
- Preserves decision rationale and context

**Session Summary** (`summary.md`):
```markdown
# Work Package Session Summary

**Work Package:** [Name]
**PR:** #[number]
**Sessions:** [Count]
**Date Range:** YYYY-MM-DD to YYYY-MM-DD

## Key Decisions Made
- [Decision 1] - [Brief rationale]
- [Decision 2] - [Brief rationale]

## Assumptions Confirmed
- [Assumption 1]
- [Assumption 2]

## Issues Encountered
- [Issue 1] - [Resolution]

## Lessons Learned
- [Insight 1]
- [Insight 2]
```

**Privacy Rules:**
- ❌ NEVER commit history files to the repository
- ❌ NEVER reference history files in committed documentation
- ❌ NEVER copy history content to `.engineering/artifacts/` or any committed location
- ✅ ONLY store in `.engineering/agent/metadata/` (private, gitignored)
- ✅ Ensure `.engineering/agent/` is in `.gitignore`

### 10.2 After PR Merged

Update work package plan status:
```markdown
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED
**PR:** #42
**Merged:** [Date]
```

### 10.3 Select Next Work Package

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

| Don't | Why |
|-------|-----|
| Skip issue verification | No traceability, unclear requirements, stakeholders can't track (see [Issue Creation Guide](github-issue-creation.guide.md)) |
| Prescribe solutions in issues | Issues define problems, not implementations; constrains design options. **Never include "Solution", "Implementation Approach", algorithms, or code locations in issues.** |
| Skip elicitation without asking user | User should decide if elicitation is needed; assumptions compound into wrong implementation |
| Skip research without asking user | User should decide if research is needed; may miss patterns, best practices, or baseline analysis |
| Accept vague requirements | Hidden ambiguity becomes hidden assumptions |
| Mix requirements and solutions | Constrains design options; keep "what" separate from "how" |
| Skip scope boundaries | Leads to scope creep; always define in/out lists |
| Implement on main/master | Pollutes main branch, no PR review, risky deploys |
| Skip branch creation | Same as above; always create dedicated feature branch |
| Skip ADR creation (major features) | For major features, ADR documents final architecture after implementation; captures actual decisions made |
| Delay PR creation | PR should be created in Phase 1 with initial changelog; establishes work package immediately |
| Create non-draft PR | PRs must start as drafts to signal work-in-progress status |
| Skip PR assignment | PRs must be assigned to m2ux for tracking |
| Use relative ADR links in PR | Relative links resolve to main; use branch-specific URLs (when ADR exists) |
| Skip testing | "I'll add tests later" never happens |
| Complete WP with failing tests | ALL tests (unit, integration, e2e) must pass—no exceptions |
| Ignore unrelated test failures | Investigate first; they may indicate breaking changes |
| Monolithic commits | Can't track issues, hard to review/revert |
| Poor commit messages | No context for future maintainers |
| Skip architectural significance check | Creates unnecessary ADRs for trivial changes or misses ADRs for significant ones |
| Skip ADR for architecturally significant decisions | Decision rationale lost forever (see [Architecture Review Guide](architecture-review.guide.md)) |
| Modify historical ADRs | ADRs are immutable historical records; create new ADR if decision changes |
| Skip test plan | No traceability from docs to tests (see [Test Plan Creation Guide](test-plan.guide.md)) |
| Skip validation | Broken code gets merged |
| Multiple WPs at once | Mixed commits, confusing PRs |
| Skip planning | Scope creep, wasted effort |
| Skip checkpoints | Assumptions lead to wrong implementation |
| Skip assumption review | Hidden design decisions compound errors; user loses opportunity to correct course early |
| Skip KB research | Missing applicable patterns and practices (see [KB Research Guide](knowledge-base-research.guide.md)) |
| Skip `get_guidance` at session start | Inefficient searching, wrong tool selection, excessive tool calls |
| Narrate search process | Users want synthesized answers with citations, not play-by-play of searches |
| Skip analysis | No baseline, can't measure success, miss opportunities (see [Implementation Analysis Guide](implementation-analysis.guide.md)) |
