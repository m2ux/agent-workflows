# Knowledge Base Research Guide

**Purpose:** Guidelines for researching the knowledge base during work package planning to discover relevant concepts, design patterns, and best practices.

---

## Overview

Before designing a solution, research the knowledge base using concept-rag MCP tools. This surfaces:
- **Best Practices** - Industry-standard approaches
- **Design Patterns** - Proven solutions applicable to the work package
- **Architectural Choices** - Guidance on system structure
- **Documentation Style** - Conventions for inline docs and ADRs
- **Testing Strategies** - Approaches to testing similar functionality

> **Key Insight:** Informed design decisions come from understanding what patterns and practices already exist in your knowledge base. Skip this step, and you risk reinventing the wheel or missing proven approaches.

---

## When to Apply This Guide

**Always research when:**
- Work package involves architectural decisions
- Multiple implementation approaches are possible
- Domain is unfamiliar or complex
- Performance or reliability requirements exist

**Lightweight research acceptable when:**
- Simple, well-understood change
- Following existing established patterns
- Minor bug fix with clear solution

---

## Research Tools

Use concept-rag MCP tools to query the knowledge base.

### ⚠️ MANDATORY: Call get_guidance First

**At the start of any knowledge base research session, call `get_guidance` before making other concept-rag MCP tool calls.**

The `get_guidance` tool returns research guidelines that ensure:
- **Correct tool selection** - Which tool to use for your specific query type
- **Efficient searching** - Aim for 4-6 tool calls maximum per research session
- **Proper answer synthesis** - How to combine results into coherent findings

> **Note:** Call `get_guidance` once per research session, not before each individual search tool call. The returned guidance applies for the duration of the session.

**Communication rule:** Never narrate your search process to the user. Instead, synthesize answers directly and cite sources. The user wants findings, not a play-by-play of tool calls.

### Available Tools

| Tool | Purpose | When to Use |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `get_guidance` | Get research guidelines | **ALWAYS call first** |
| `broad_chunks_search` | Find content across ALL documents | Start here with work package keywords |
| `concept_search` | Find where concepts are discussed | Track specific concept mentions |
| `catalog_search` | Discover documents about topics | Find authoritative sources |
| `chunks_search` | Search within a known document | Deep dive into identified docs |
| `list_concepts_in_category` | See concepts in a domain | Explore conceptual landscape |

---

## Research Strategy

### Step 0: Get Guidance (MANDATORY)

**Always start by calling `get_guidance`** to receive current research guidelines:

```
Tool: get_guidance
```

This returns tool selection rules, search efficiency tips, and synthesis guidelines specific to the knowledge base. Follow the returned guidance throughout your research session.

### Step 1: Start Broad

Use `broad_chunks_search` with work package keywords:

```
Query: "caching strategy performance optimization"
Query: "error handling retry patterns"
Query: "API versioning backward compatibility"
```

**Goal:** Identify recurring themes and relevant documents.

### Step 2: Identify Key Concepts

From initial results, note:
- Recurring terminology
- Referenced design patterns
- Mentioned best practices
- Cited sources or documents

### Step 3: Find Authoritative Sources

Use `catalog_search` to find documents about identified topics:

```
Query: "distributed systems caching"
Query: "API design guidelines"
```

**Goal:** Locate primary sources for deeper exploration.

### Step 4: Extract Specific Guidance

Use `chunks_search` on identified documents to find:
- Implementation recommendations
- Trade-off discussions
- Warning signs or anti-patterns
- Configuration guidelines

### Step 5: Map to Work Package

Connect findings to requirements:
- Which patterns apply directly?
- What modifications are needed?
- What risks do sources mention?
- What success metrics are suggested?

## Quality Indicators

### Good Research

- ✅ Multiple sources consulted
- ✅ Patterns validated across documents
- ✅ Direct quotes or specific references included
- ✅ Clear mapping to work package needs
- ✅ Risks and anti-patterns identified

### Insufficient Research

- ❌ Single source only
- ❌ Vague or generic findings
- ❌ No specific pattern recommendations
- ❌ Missing risk assessment
- ❌ No clear connection to requirements

---

## Examples

### Good Research Finding

```markdown
### Caching Strategy
**Source:** System Design Patterns, Chapter 7
**Relevance:** Work package requires improving API response times
**Key Insight:** "Write-through caching provides consistency at the cost of 
write latency; write-behind improves write performance but risks data loss 
on failure. For read-heavy workloads with tolerance for eventual consistency, 
write-behind with periodic flush is recommended."

**Application:** Our API is 90% reads, 10% writes. Write-behind with 5-second 
flush interval balances performance and durability for our use case.
```

### Poor Research Finding

```markdown
### Caching
We should probably use caching to make things faster.
